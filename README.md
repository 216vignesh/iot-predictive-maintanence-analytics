# IoT device Predictive Maintenance and Management
By Vignesh Sundaram, Sai Manikandan, Shrishailya Chavan
## Goal
- Our ultimate goal is to build a non-exclusive end-to-end IoT device predictive maintenance and management solution, from on-field devices all the way to a web console.


## Repository structure
- `code/iot_project.ipynb`: the main code for our project, including modules for:
  1. Data ETL/EDA
  2. Model Training
  3. Model Testing
  4. Anomaly Detection Fitting/Testing
  5. Plot
- `dataset/demo_data.zip`: The raw dataset we actually used for final result.
